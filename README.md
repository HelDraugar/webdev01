	Universial Accessbility  
 

We started by considering the size of the page, and came to the conclusion that the most beneficial layout would be a page that did not require scrolling. Furthermore, we decided that it would be smart to have the page in as few set pieces as possible. We therefore created a header, content and a footer. 

For the visual accessibility we decided that it would be best with colors that were high contrast, or as with the menu itself a soft background with black text. Using a white background and black text caused irritation when looking at the menu, and we therefore experimented with a soft background color that was easy on the eye. 

We tried to keep the number of elements to a minimum, and have them clear and easy to find. We did not want to present the user with a wealth of information. This could be overwhelming and frankly quite annoying. This again is reflected in the simplicity of color selection, and design. The menu is therefore intentionally simplistic. We were not overly sure of the standard for marking allergens on restaurant menus, we had all been to restaurants that mark them in italic text, so we went with that option. We tried to be conscious about color blindness, but we are no experts. That is part of the reason for so few colors. 

We tried to imagine people with different eye-sight issues, for example color blindness, nearsightedness, but also people not used to the internet, most commonly this would be older people. For the older generation we felt it important to keep everything as simple as possible, and making necessary information easily obtainable, in short keep it simple keep it stupid. 

 

We ran our html through https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php, the likely problems we faced were the one with img src link with a missing alt tag. We got a hit that our html lang codes were wrong, but as far as we have understood it, we followed ISO convention. There were also suggestions to change our <b> and <I> tags, we replaced them with <strong> and <em> respectively.
